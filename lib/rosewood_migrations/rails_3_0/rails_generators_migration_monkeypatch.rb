    module Migration    
      # Creates a migration template at the given destination. The difference
      # to the default template method is that the migration version is appended
      # to the destination file name.
      #
      # The migration version, migration file name, migration class name are
      # available as instance variables in the template to be rendered.
      #
      # This version of the method is monkey-patched to implement two improvements.
      # First, the filename ends in a string of digits representing a timestamp -
      # normally in a Rails migration the filename *begins* with that string. This
      # allows us to use Unix tab-completion. Second, the migration filename is
      # automatically copied into the OS X copy/paste or "clipboard" buffer. This
      # feature is not supported on other operating systems and this gem might not
      # work on other operating systems.
      #
      # ==== Examples
      #
      #   migration_template "migration.rb", "db/migrate/add_foo_to_bar.rb"
      #
      
      # Wrapping this in a method_added callback may inspire cries 
      # of "WTF?!," so let me explain that without it, rails seems to load these
      # files before all of itself, so these changes are overwritten when 
      # rails is fully loaded.
