# TODO: This does not overwrite the Rails db:migrate:status rake task.

# duplicate the existing Rails db:migrate stuff, with just a few key changes. as an aside, I
# wish I had time to refactor this shit, because my God, this is a lot of copy-and-paste for
# the benefit of a very small number of actual changes. specifically, eleven total characters
# in five lines of code.
